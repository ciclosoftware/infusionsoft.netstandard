# infusionsoft.netstandard
Implementation for the Infusionsoft REST Api on .NET Standard.

It includes IntegrationTests which also serve as examples for you. They can be run if you provide Authorization Code, Access Token and/or Refresh Token.

It will include an E2E test as example solution for OAuth2 Authorization Code workflow using a .NET Core WebApp with an Angular 6 Frontend. 

Also, there will be implementaions and examples for registering and listening to RestHooks.

It will be available through NuGet anytime soon!

The functionality is growing as it is migrated from another project step-by-step, but it won't include YET a complete coverage of Infusionsoft's API. 
The first set of functions is documented in this post:

Please let me know if you need anything that is still missing, and I can prioritize it! 

The implementation comes from a project that has ended, and that we can proudly publish as Open Source. May it help you to successfully implement your Infusionsoft integrations with .NET (or even Angular as well)! 

HAPPY PLANTING
