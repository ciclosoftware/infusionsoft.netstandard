# infusionsoft.netstandard
Implementation for the Infusionsoft REST Api on .NET Standard.

It includes IntegrationTests which also serve as examples for you. They can be run if you provide Authorization Code, Access Token and/or Refresh Token.

It includes an E2E test as example solution for OAuth2 Authorization Code workflow using a .NET Core WebApp with an Angular 6 Frontend. 

The functionality is growing as it is migrated from another project step-by-step.

Please let us know if there is anything you need urgently. 

The implementation comes from a project that has ended, and that we can proudly publish as Open Source. May it help you to successfully implement your Infusionsoft integrations with .NET (or even Angular as well)!
